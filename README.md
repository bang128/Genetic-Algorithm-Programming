# Genetic-Algorithm-Programming
##Objective: 
Develop a program for genetic algorithm, randomly generate a list of chromosomes, build selection, crossover and mutation approach to develop new generations
##Method:
- Programmed in Python; utilized random functions from numpy to generate and mutate chromosomes with a given normal distribution; calculated fitness scores
- Built Roulette Wheel selection to select chromosomes regarding fitness scores
- Created uniform and 1-kpoint crossover
